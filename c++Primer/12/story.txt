sam had a dog
its name was tod
it was very helpful but it ate too much
so he didn't like it
he wanted to kill tod
he tied tod in a bag and put it in the small boat
he rowed the boat to the middle of the big river
just as he threw the poor animal into the river
the boat began to sink
both began sam and tod fell into the river
tod was able to swim
but sam couldn't 
the dog bit the rope and broke it
it tried its best to swim to save sam
the man was saved so he was very thankful to the dog
he didn't want to kill the dog anymore
from then on he gave the dog as much food as it wanted
